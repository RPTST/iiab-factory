# To install Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) 6.7 / pre-release onto Raspbian Stretch,
# Ubuntu 18.04 or Debian 9, run this 1-line installer:
#
#                 curl d.iiab.io/install.txt | sudo bash

# 1. WARNING: NOOBS IS *NOT* SUPPORTED, as its partitioning is very different.
#    To attempt IIAB 6.7 on another Linux see the full/manual instructions:
#    https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Installation#do-everything-from-scratch

# 2. An Ethernet cable is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED during installation, as this is
#    more reliable than Wi-Fi (and faster!)  If however you must install over
#    Wi-Fi, remember to run "iiab-hotspot-on" after IIAB installation, TO
#    ACTIVATE YOUR RASPBERRY PI's INTERNAL WIFI HOTSPOT (and kill its Internet)

# 3. Run 'sudo raspi-config' on RPi, to set LOCALISATION OPTIONS

# 4. OPTIONAL: if you have slow/pricey Internet, pre-position KA Lite's
#    mandatory 0.9 GB English Pack (en.zip) within /tmp -- if nec grab a copy
#    from http://pantry.learningequality.org/downloads/ka-lite/0.17/content/contentpacks/en.zip

# 5. WHEN YOU RUN 1-LINE INSTALLER ("curl d.iiab.io/install.txt | sudo bash")
#    REMEMBER TO THEN TYPE YOUR PASSWORD IF ON UBUNTU/DEBIAN/ETC (for sudo)

# 6. Follow on-screen instructions (TYPE "sudo iiab" TO RESUME IF EVER NEC!)

# 7. IIAB AUTO-REBOOTS WHEN DONE (typically 1-to-3 hours later) which sets
#    hostname, improves RTC + memory mgmt, and starts BitTorrents if nec

# 8. EXPLORE IIAB: http://box or http://box.lan or http://172.18.96.1 THEN
#    ADD CONTENT at http://box/admin (read http://FAQ.IIAB.IO for passwords!)
