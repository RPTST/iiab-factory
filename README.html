<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/">Raspbian Stretch</a>, <a href="http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/">Ubuntu 18.04</a> or <a href="https://www.debian.org/distrib/">Debian 9</a>, run this 1-line installer:

OS TIPS & TRICKS: click the above link (that ends in .txt) for important
recommendations on how to PREPARE & SECURE YOUR OS.

WARNING: NOOBS IS *NOT* SUPPORTED, as its partitioning is very different.
To attempt IIAB 6.7 on <a href=https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Platforms>another Linux</a> see the <a href="https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Installation#do-everything-from-scratch">full/manual instructions</a>.

An Ethernet cable is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED during installation, as this is more
reliable than Wi-Fi (and faster too!)  If however you must install over Wi-Fi,
remember to run "iiab-hotspot-on" after IIAB installation, TO ACTIVATE YOUR
RASPBERRY PI's INTERNAL WIFI HOTSPOT (thereby killing Internet connectivity!)
