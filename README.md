# iiab-factory
Some overlap with previous, but is Timâ€™s toolkit for deploying iiab. Others are free to use, but it is not 'official'.  It might, for example, have an install script that installs ansible and git if needed, clones iiab, copies a particular local_vars.yml to iiab, runs the iiab install, and then clones other repos like iiab-admin and iiab-menu and installs them.
